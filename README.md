# Pomodoro

Pomodoro-style website, including:
- User can set their own options; break length and work length
- Cute tomato icon
- Dark mode and light mode toggle option


To add in the future:
- Clicking the tomato increases the timer by 2 minutes (and makes the tomato bounce!)
- Pause timer option
- User has to click to start the break / start the next work session


*All images for this are highkey stolen off google, if i publish this i should draw my own*
